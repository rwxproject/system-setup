  # Secret template is optional. If set, these annotations
  # and labels will be copied to the secret named example-com-tls.

  # Note: Labels and annotations from the template are only synced to the Secret at the time when the certificate
  # is created or renewed. Currently labels and annotations can only be added, but not removed. Removing any
  # labels or annotations from the template or removing the template itself will have no effect.
